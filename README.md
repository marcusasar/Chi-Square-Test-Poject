# Chi-Square Test of Independence

## Objective:
This project aims to conduct a Chi-Square Test of Independence to analyze whether there is a relationship between **gender** and **frequency of visits** (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Rarely, Never).

## Dataset:
The dataset used is based on a survey of 122 people, where we observe their **gender** and **frequency of visits**.

## Hypothesis:
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: There is no relationship between gender and and frequency of visits.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: There is relationship between gender and frequency of visits.

## Results:
After performing the Chi-Square Test, the p-value was found to be **0.1599** (greater than 0.05), so we **fail to reject the null hypothesis**, indicating that there is **no significant relationship** between gender and frequency of visits.
